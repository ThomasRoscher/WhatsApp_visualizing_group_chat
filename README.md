# WhatsApp_visualizing_group_chat

For this small project I wanted to see if the WhatApp data of me and my friends yields any information. Thus, I analyzed our main group chat in which about 30 people communicate on a daily basis (about 20.000 messages within 3 years). I found that even with little data you can get quiet some interesting findings including, who wrote the most messages, what daytime and day of the week are messages written, how did the overall amount changed over time, how many messages are just emoticons or pictures and what are the most used words.
